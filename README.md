# Devise

##Â *Difficulties*
There are a fair amount of commands to use. The relationship check in the console confused me a bit since when creating a user, I didn't realise that I had to assign password as a property. I am starting to get used to the User.last to assign new Users.

## *Pleased*
I am pleased that I am able to understand the sheer amount of commands and code that we have went through.

Overall I feel like in order to be good at this, I will just need to practice making new rails until it becomes second nature. I understand what each commands do so now just reiterate until it is fluent to me.
